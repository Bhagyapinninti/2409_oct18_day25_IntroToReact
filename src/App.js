      <h1>Classical Dances of India</h1>
      <p>
        India has many classical dance styles, each with its own unique style
        and regional variations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bharatanatyam (Tamil Nadu)</li>
        <li>Kathak (North India, primarily Uttar Pradesh)</li>
        <li>Kathakali (Kerala)</li>
        <li>Kuchipudi (Andhra Pradesh)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Indian classical dancing started around 200 BCE in India, as a joyful
        and celebratory activity, often in devotion to Hindu deities. Many of
        the performances are choreographed to retell stories of the gods and
        other historical accounts. All styles of Indian classical dance are
        vibrant, expressive, and spiritual. Dance performances usually take
        place at festivals, universities, various cultural events, and more. The
        dancers who perform these styles are usually professionals who have
        devoted years of study and practice in their respective style of Indian
        classical dance. In performances, the dancers move to the beat of the
        song or music that is playing; in some styles, such as Kathak, bells are
        worn around the ankles at times for added rhythmic effect when the feet
        are stomped. The dancer takes the role of the character that they are
        portraying in the performance, the composition being specific, and
        become emotionally connected with the story and the audience.

      <p>
        Bharatanatyam is an Indian classical dance form that originated in Tamil
        Nadu, India. It is a classical dance form recognized by the Sangeet
        Natak Akademi, and expresses South Indian religious themes and spiritual
        ideas of Hinduism and Jainism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bharatanatyam contains different types of bani. Bani, or "tradition", is
        a term used to describe the dance technique and style specific to a guru
        or school, often named for the village of the guru. Bharatanatyam style
        is noted for its fixed upper torso, bent legs, and flexed knees
        (Aramandi) combined with footwork, and a vocabulary of sign language
        based on gestures of hands, eyes, and face muscles.The dance is
        accompanied by music and a singer, and typically the dancer's guru is
        present as the nattuvanar or director-conductor of the performance and
        art. The performance repertoire of Bharatanatyam, like other classical
        dances, includes nrita (pure dance), nritya (Conveys a meaning to the
        audience through hand gestures) and natya (Consists of the elements of
        drama). A program of bharatanatyam usually lasts two hours without
        interruption and includes a specific list of procedures, all performed
        by one dancer, who does not leave the stage or change costume. The
        accompanying orchestra—composed of drums, drone, and singer—occupies the
        back of the stage, led by the guru, or the teacher, of the dancer.

      <h2>Kathak</h2>
      <img src="./images/kathak.jpg" alt=""></img>
      <p>
        Kathak is one of the nine major forms of Indian classical dance. Its
        origin is attributed to the traveling bards in ancient northern India
        known as Kathakar ("storyteller"), who communicated stories from the
        Hindu epics through dance, songs and music. Its name derives from the
        Sanskrit word katha which means "story", and kathakar which means "the
        one who tells a story", or "to do with stories". Kathak dancers tell
        various stories utilizing hand movements and extensive footwork, their
        body movements and flexibility as well as their facial expressions.
        Kathak often has a strong beat and can be danced in many taals. While
        proto-Kathak elements can be seen long before, Kathak evolved during the
        Bhakti movement, particularly by incorporating the childhood and stories
        of the Hindu god Krishna, as well as independently in the courts of
        north Indian kingdoms. During the period of Mughal rule, the emperors
        were patrons of Kathak dance and actively promoted it in their royal
        courts. Kathak performances include Urdu ghazal and commonly used
        instruments brought during the Mughal period.As a result, it is the only
        Indian classical dance form to feature Persian elements.

        ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of Natya Shastra.It developed as a religious
        art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs, like all

        instruments in Kuchipudi are mridangam, cymbals, veena, flute and the
